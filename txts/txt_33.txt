De Novo CG Due to Calcineurin Inhibitor

  

CG Complicating IgA Nephropathy

 

 

(Leh) De novo Cc developed in 5 oH
the native kidneys ofthis

patient 10 years post heart

arteriolar hyalinosis was also
present, related to cyclosporin
‘therapy. (Right) loa
‘nephropathy can present with
superimposed C6, asin this

deposits The disease typically
rapidly progresses with end-
stage renal disease (ESA) in
90%

Malaria

    
  

(Left) A biopsy is depicted
{From a 28-year-old black
woman who returned from
‘South Africa with Plasmodium
falciparum malaria and new
‘onset of nephrotic syndrome.
‘Black patients with certain
‘APOL! variants have a much
greater risk of developing CG
secondary to other forms of
‘glomerular disease. (Right)
Tubuloreticular inclusions 65}
‘are present in endothelial cells
jin CG secondary to HIV
infection; these are nat often
‘resent in other causes of CG,
except those related to high
interferon states.

      

 

Tubuloreticular Structures Due to
Interferon Therapy

Intracapiliary leukocytes are
‘also present, a feature ofthe
cellular variant of FSGS.

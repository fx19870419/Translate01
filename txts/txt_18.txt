assification (Columbia): Adhesions are
distributed [not otherwise specified (NOS)] at
jproximal tubule (ip variant) or at hilum (perihilar
tiglomeruli may show endocapillary hypercellularity
variant) or tut colapse (collapsing variant)

 

 

 

 

mechanisms of podocyte loss are likely
TGFBIsmeciatorin animal models
Podocyte detachment &/or cell death
ite loss leads to bare GBM, promoting adhesion and
iby parietal epithelial cells
Plasma Factor
fig often vigorously recurs after renal transplant,
within minutes of reperfusion (recurrent FSGS)
IL FSGS patient serum causes proteinuria in rats,
isolated from these rats have 1 glomerular

Primary

CLINICAL ISSUES
Epidemiology
'* Incidence
© 2.2% oF ESRD in USA (2004-2008)
~ 11.6% oF ESRD in children (2008-2014)
© Increasing incidence in children and adults
~ F5GS-related ESRD increased 49x from 1980 to 2000
‘© ~20% of adult renal biopsies for nephrotic syndrome
© 30-70% NOS, 20-40% tp, 35% cellular (more common in
children)
© Age
© Mean age at onset: ~ 37-50 years in adults, ~ 6-7 years in
children
© sex
© Male preponderance (1.5-3x)
© Ethnicity
(© ESRD from FSGS 4-5x more common in individuals oF
recent African descent due to APOL!riskalleles
~ African descent: Lifetime risk 1:556
~ Caucasians: Lifetime risk 1:2,500
Presentation
+ Sudden onset nephroticrange proteinuria (> 3.5 g/d), often
with Full nephrotic syndrome
(© ~ 60% with NOS variant
© ~97% with tip variant
Treatment
© Drugs
© Steroids
~ Limited response rate (~ 33%) and frequent relapse
~ Tip variant often responds to steroids (80%) with
‘complete remission in 60%, similar to minimal change
disease (MCD)
© 2ndtine therapies: Cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide,
‘mycophenolate mofetil rituximab, plasmapheresis,
© ACE inhibitors to 4 proteinuria and tubular injury
© Abatacept (under stud): Targets B7-1 (CD80) and led to
remission of proteinuria in small series
Prognosis
© Wide range due to diverse patient selection and therapies
‘© ESRD in 35 years according to pathologic classification
(© NOS variant: 20-37%
© Tipvariant: 624%
© Cellular variant: 033%
© Perihilar:0-37%
© Collapsing: 18-70%
«Risk Factors for ESRD: Heavy proteinuria, elevated Cr, HTN
at time of biopsy, Failure to respond to therapy; other
lesions in tip variant

MICROSCOPIC

Histologic Features
‘© Glomeruli (NOS variant)
‘© Adhesion of glomerular capillaries to BC
~ Randomly distributed (by definition, not at tip or
perihilar)
~ Sometimes epithelia cell bridging between BC and

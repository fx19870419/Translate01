-glomerul are preferentially
located at the
corticomedullary junction,
which should be included to
consider the sample adequate.

‘the adhesion isnot an artifact.
Identification of the

Adhesion With Bridging by Parietal

F) (Leh) An adhesion has a cell
bridging between the
laminated BC and the GBM,
The presence of a BC reaction
helps distinguish areal
adhesion from one created as
‘a biopsy artifact with
‘compression of the tuft
‘against the capsule. (Right)
Periilar adhesion -3'and
hyaline 23 deposition are
present in > 50% of glomerull

B pattern is most common in
secondary, maladaptive FSGS
(nephron overload). Note the

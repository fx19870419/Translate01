ANCILLARY TESTS:
Immunofluorescence
© IgM and C3 with segmental or global deposits in collapsed
segments, less common with deposits of C1q
* 9G, IgA, and albumin in visceral epithelial protein
resorption droplets
‘* Tubules have epithelial protein resorption droplets,
containing plasma proteins (IgG, IgA, C3, albumin, and
thers)
Electron Microscopy
'* Podocyte hypertrophy overlying areas of collapse
© Foot processes are extensively effaced
© Contain electron-dense protein resorption droplets,
electrorlucent transport vesicles, and increased
‘numbers of organelles, including prominent rough
endoplasmic reticulum
© Podocytes detached from GBM with interposition of
newly Formed extracellular matrix

© Multiple layers of newly formed GBM between podocyte
andoriginal GaM
‘© Actin cytoskeleton disrupted, making cytoplasm appear
‘open and pale
‘© Podocytes become cuboidal
° cam
© Wrinkled GBM in areas of collapse
© GBM not appreciably thickened
‘© Absent electron-dense deposits except for small, rare
Paramesangial deposits
‘© Glomerular endothelium
‘© Tubuloreticular inclusions can be present in cases with
high interferon-states, including HIV nephropathy, and in
lupus-assocated forms
Immunohistochemistry
* Ki67 (MIB-1), proliferation marker, is postive inactivated
Parietal and visceral epithelial cells
‘© Podocytes rarely express Ki-67 (< 1/glomerulus)

 

Collapsing Glomerulopathy

 
   
   

  

© Proximal tubular cells also have increased Ki-67 staining
'* Loss of normal podocyte markers on glomerular tuft
© WT1, synaptopodin, podocin, podocalyxin, GLEPP1, a-
actinin, CD35, and CD10
© Gain of markers of parietal epithelial cells
© Pax-2, claudin-1, CK8/18, CD44 (migration marker)
‘ Epithelial phenotype alterations do occur in other Forms oF
FSGS with podocyte loss but to much lesser degree

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
FSGS, Not Otherwise Specified

‘ Podoxyte proliferation and hypercellularity minimal

‘More hyalinosis, sclerosis, and capsular adhesions

'* One collapsing lesion Forces classification to Cin Columbis
classification

FSGS, Cellular Variant

* Endocapillary hypercellularity distinguishes cellular variant

'* May be in CG spectrum because of overlapping Features,

* Cellular variant also has t Ki-67 and cytokeratin expression
invisceral epithelial cells and 4 WT1, CD10, c-actinin

Glomerulonephritis With Crescents

'* True crescents usually contain fibrin and spindle-shaped
cells that lack reabsorption droplets

‘* Periglomerular inflammation, necrotizing lesions in capil
tuft and GBM breaks absent in CG

Superimposed on Other Glomerular Diseases

‘© Diagnostic Features of underlying glomerular disease also
Present (e.g., IGA nephropathy, lupus nephritis, diabetes)

‘© Typically marked proteinuria and rapid progression to ESRD

‘© Associated with APOL risk variants

‘Superimposed on Arterial Disease
‘© Characteristic vascular lesions: TMA, severe arteriolar
hyalinosis, or atheroembolism,

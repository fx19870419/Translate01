KEY FACTS

ETIOLOGY/PATHOGENESIS

* Idiopathic disease with podocytopenia and parietal cell
activation

‘* Plasma factor and genetic predisposition

CLINICAL ISSUES

* Common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children and
adults (15-20% of biopsies)

‘* More common in patients of African descent

© Therapy
© Minority respond to steroids (~ 33%)
© Cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, plasmapheresis
© Under study: Rituximab, abatacept

‘© Recurs in transplants

MICROSCOPIC

© 5 pathologic variants (Columbia classification)

© Not otherwise specified (NOS): Random distribution of
adhesions (commonest)

 

(Left) FSGS is aight
‘microscopic pattern of ;
segmental glomerular scarring al
affecting some glomerul,
‘ically with hyaline Band
‘adhesion to the Bowman
capsule (BO). Most ofthe
‘lomerulus appears normal
podocstes show reactive

Features of FSGS are sparing
of some glomeruli focal) and
partial involvement of
affected tufts (segmento).

IgM in Segmental Scar

(Left) 1M is seamentally
‘resent in the scarred segment
of the glomerulus 8,
‘representing entrapped
‘macromolecules. C3is
‘typically also present in
‘Scarred segments. Otherwise,
little or no immunoreactants
‘are present. (Right) Electron
‘microscopy (EM) in primary
FSGS reveals extensive foot
process effacement land is
‘often indstinguishable from
‘minimal change disease. The
GBM is usually of normal
thickness. No electron-dense
deposits are present. Areas of
denuded GBM can be present.

‘TOP DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSES

‘© Secondary forms of FSGS with known cause

© Minimal change disease

* FSGS superimposed on other glomerular diseases
DIAGNOSTIC CHECKLIST

‘Multiple levels may be needed to sample segmental scar

* FSGS NOS is diagnosis of exclusion; other diseases can
‘cause segmental glomerular scars

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Focal Glomerulonephritis

© IgAnephropathy, lupus, and other inflammatory
‘lomerulonephritis can result in segmental scars in
glomeruli

‘© Breaks in GBM sometimes evident in PAS/silver stains (not
seen in FSGS)

‘Minimal Change Disease

# Nosegmental sclerosis, unless segmental sclerosis is
preexistent due to other etiology

© Numerous globally sclerotic glomeruli IF, and vascular
changes in patient with nephrotic syndrome are suggestive
OF FSGS even if no segmental lesions are seen,

DIAGNOSTIC CHECKLIST
Pathologic interpretation Pearls
‘* Multiple levels (step sections) may be needed to identify
Focal segmental lesions
‘¢ Note whether corticomedullary junction is sampled
‘© Adequate sample of glomeruliis crucial to make diagnosis

of FSGS since Focal lesions may be missed with small.
samples

© For example, biopsy with 10 glomeruli has 35%
probability of missing focal lesion present in 10% of
‘glomeruli in kidney, whereas probability decreases to
12% if 20 glomeruli are sampled

‘© Repeat biopsies show transition to NOS category in ~ 50%

Cf patients with non-NOS patterns on initial biopsy

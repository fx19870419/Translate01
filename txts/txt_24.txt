(Left) Trichrome stain of a
biopsy with the cellular
variant of FSGS shows most
glomerular capillaries filed
with mononuclear cells with
‘abundant, sometimes foamy
cytoplasm BB. (Right) In this
BR case of FSGS (celular variant),

the glomerulus shows
‘ntracapitiary cells BB and
‘adhesions to the BCEBL

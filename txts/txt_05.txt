© Corticosteroids primary treatment
= 90-95% of children respond within 8 weeks, 85-90%
‘of adults respond within 20 weeks
~ Steroids often used as empirical treatmentin children
5 IF no response, renal biopsy performed to identify
cause of nephrotic syndrome.
~ Relapse within 1st year in up to 50% of children and
60-75% oF adults
‘2 Usually treated with another course of steroids
© Treatment of steroid nonresponders
~ Cyclophosphamide, levamisole, cyclosporine;
rituximab (off label)
~ Abatacept (CTLA4g) (off label)
~ Repeat biopsy to detect FSGS
Prognosis
‘© Primary (idiopathic)
© Rarely, iFever, leads to ESRD without development of
FSGS
© Adults with MCD and acute renal failure also usually Fully
recover
‘© Relapses common and often lead to steroid dependence
«© Secondary: Remits. underlying condition can be cured
# MCD may be initial manifestation of FSGS (~ 5%), in which
‘ase prognosisis that of FSCS

MACROSCOPIC
General Features

Enlarged, waxy, yellow cortex due to lipid accumulation in,
proximal tubules

MICROSCOPIC

Histologic Features
© Glomerul
© Normal by ight microscopy (LM)
= Slight 7 in mesangial cellularity and matrixin minority
= Normal GBM
= Normal glomerular size
‘© Podocytes may be swollen and prominent with
basophilic cytoplasm
= Albumin reabsorption droplets in podocytes
© Loss of negative charge revealed by 4 colloidal iron stain
along GBM
© Globally sclerotic glomeruli may be seen in MCD in adults
~ 10% oF glomeruli may be sclerotic by age 40 and 30%
byage 80
© Inchildren, involuted glomeruli are sometimes present
~ Lack oF atrophic tubules indicates developmental
rather than acquired glomerular sclerosis
© Tubules
© Protein resorption droplets (‘hyaline droplets”)
~ PAS(+) and red on trichrome stain
© Lipid droplets
~ Origin of term “ipoid nephrosis”
~ Clear vacuoles on H&E, PAS, and trichrome
~ Red droplets on ol red stained frozen sections
© Usually little tono tubular atrophy
— Older patients with concurrent arteriosclerosis may
have underlying glomerular obsolescence and tubular
atrophy

 

© Tubular regenerative changes and injuryin adults with
acute renal failure
«Interstitial inflammation and fibrosis are usually absent
© Interstitial Foam cells may be seen but are rare

ANCILLARY TESTS:
Immunofluorescence
© Can be negative, but faint granular “dusting” of IgG over
odocytes is seen in some cases
‘© Minority have faint (< 14) staining in glomeruli for igM + C3.
(© <5% of MCD cases have mesangial taining for !9G, IgM,
1g, C1, 8/or C3, particularly in children
= May predict higher rate of steroid resistance
‘* Renal tubular resorption droplets stain for albumin + 1g and.

Electron Microscopy
© Podocyte FPE
© Foot processes retract and cell body spreads on GBM
{not Fusion")
© Diffuse, usually involving > 75% of capillary surface
— Extent (% of surface) correlates with severity of
proteinuria in some but not all reports
© Morphometry
~ Mean foot process width (1,566 429 nm vs, 472+ 52
‘Am normal); median 1,725 nm vs. 562 nm
— Number of Feet/10 jm of GBM (0.84 + 0.24 vs. 3.84
18normal)
‘© After remission, Foot processes return toward normal,
although some persistent change observed
‘© FPE occurs in any renal disease with severe glomerular
proteinuria
© Other usual podocyte abnormalities:
‘© Vacuolization and microvillous transformation
© Resorption droplets and 1 cellular organelles
‘© 1 numbers of filtration slit diaphragms
‘Mild mesangial expansion in minority of cases
‘© Vague mesangial and paramesangial electron densities,
probably due to nonspecific protein insudation
 Tubules
‘© Proximal tubules contain electron-dense resorption
droplets (secondary lysosomes) and electron-lucent lipid
droplets
Immunohistochemistry
@ 4 nephrin along GBM, corresponding with loss of slit
diaphragms
‘© Nephrin loss is seen in other diseases with FPE,
particularly in advanced stages
‘© Markers that favor FSGS over MCD
‘© CD44 in parietal epithelial cells (PEC), which is marker of
activation
© Ectopic PEC markers in glomerular tuft
= Claudin-t,A-kinase anchor protein, annexin-A3
‘© Preservation of a- and B-dystroglycan in some but not:
studies
‘Marker that favors MCD over FSGS
© Decreased podocyte adystroglycan

MICROSCOPIC
Histologic Features
* Glomeruti
© Glomerulomegaly
~ Glomerul enlarged with expanded hypercelllar
mesangium
~ Universal definition of glomerulomegaty not
established, even by “gold standard” morphometric
‘methods due to significant population variability
~ Rule of thumb: Glomerular diameter > 220 ym (~ 1/2
diameter of typical 40x objective Field)
= Variable degrees, heterogeneity
© Segmental glomerulosclerosis (65)
~ Loss oF intrinsic cells & structure of glomerulus
~ Global GS may also be present
© Adhesion to Bowman capsule
~ Often in pertilar region
= Contains hyaline deposits in capillary loops
~ Hyalinosis composed of protein insudation between
GBM & endothelial cells
~ To qualify for hilar variant, > 50% of glomeruli with
segmental lesions must have perhilar GS 8/or
hyalinosis
~ Foam cells may be seen in glomeruli 8/or interstitium
© Podocyte hypertrophy & hyperplasia may be present
© Vessels
© Ateriolarhyalinosis may be in continuity with perihilar
segment of arteriole
© Tubules interstitium
© Tubular hypertrophy (tubular diameter & cell size)
‘© Atrophy & interstitial fibrosis related to J nephron
number
Specific Features by Cause
© Obesity
© Mesangial expansion, GBM thickening, &
glomerulomegaly
© Segmental lesions often perihilar with hyalinosis
© Tubulointerstitial disease often mild in comparison with
glomerular changes
* Refluxnnephropathy
© Reflux nephropathy shows prominent periglomerular
fibrosis & thickening of Bowman capsule
© Interstitial fibrosis in geographic pattern
«© Sickle cell disease
© Glomerular hypertrophy & capillary loop congestion by
sickled erythrocytes
© Glomerular capillaries may have double contours due to
thrombotic microangiopathy
* Vascular disease
© Endothelial injury, sometimes with capillary wall
remodeling (double contours)
© Vasoconstriction 8/or arteriosclerosis.
HIN
© Glomerulosclerosis occursin outer cortex, forming
subcapsular scars
© Often perihilar lesions

ANCILLARY TESTS
Immunofluorescence

* Segmental igM & C3 in glomerulosclerotic lesions
* Little or no immunoglobulin otherwise

Electron Microscopy

'* Podocyte foot process effacement (FPE) is cardinal Feature
© Typically mild or segmental FPE (often < 50%)
~ Average foot process width of < 1,500 um
distinguishes adaptive FSGS from primary FSGS (100%
sensitive & 70% specific)
© Podocyte hypertrophy & hyperplasia typically <in
primary FSCS
© Podocytes may contain protein resorption droplets
© Podocytes may detach from GBM, leaving bare GBM
 Thickened GBM > 350 nm in 70% in one series of ORG
‘* Features of particular etiologies
© Obesity-associated FSGS: Subtotal FPE & marked
glomerulomegaly
(© HIN: Ischemic wrinkling & thickening of GBM

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Primary FSGS
‘* Less glomerulomegaly, more diffuse FPE
‘© Majority NOS variant rather than perihilar

Identification of Underlying Renal Disease

‘* Look for Features of underlying immune complex,
proliferative, or nonimmune diseases

* Immune complexes may be difficult to ind in end-stage
kidneys, making diligent search necessary

Focal Glomerulonephritis

© Segmental scars may be residue of past inflammatory
glomerulonephrtis

DIAGNOSTIC CHECKLIST
Pathologic interpretation Pearls
'* Perihilar glomerulosclerosis & hypertrophy are clues to
diagnosis
* Routinely assess glomerular size in biopsies
© Normals < 50% of diameter of 40x field (440 um)

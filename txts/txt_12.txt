FSGSwith defects in a-actinin-4 (ACTN4), podocin

felatvely rare familial forms of FSGS
Neptrin interacts with CD2-associated protein

yellow kidneys due to lipid in tubules

Sclerosis involves some glomeruli (Focal) and only portion

Of glomerular tuft (segmental)

= Diagnosed even when only 1 glomerulus involved

= Global sclerosis may be incidental Finding andisnot
paticulary useful in making diagnosis of FSCS

© Adhesions (synechiae) of glomerular tuft to Bowman
space often accompany segmental sclerosis and are
often seen early in sclerosis process
Hyalinosis
~ Portion of glomerular involvement has smooth, glassy
(hyaline) appearance
~ Typically thought to occur from insudation of plasma
proteins
Increased matrix with obliteration of glomerular capillary
lumen
FSGS has zonal distribution, beginning in
corticomedullary Guxtamedulary) junction (CM)
= Important to note whether sampling of CMJ is
included
Glomerular hypertrophy often accompanies FSGS
= Potential surrogate marker in cases without sampled
segmental sclerosis
Tubules
‘© Tubular epithelial cells contain PAS(+) reabsorption
droplets due to glomerular proteinuria
© Tubular atrophy is typically only Focal early in course of
FSGS
~ TBM thickened in areas of atrophy
~ Tubular atrophy may be more prominent ate in
course of disease
© Tubulointerstitial changes pronounced in collapsing
variants of FSGS and in HIVAN
~ Gystic dilatation and more prominent lymphoid
infiltrate
‘© Intersttium
© Interstitial fibrosis (F) may be present and is typically
Focal
~ Some cases have extensive IF + tubular atrophy (TA),
and IF/TA in young patients may indicate unsampled
FSGS in patients without identified glomerulosclerosis,
© Interstitial inflammation is absent or minimal
Vessels
© Arteriolar hyalinosis and arterial intimal fibrosis may be
prominent late in course of FSGS

ANCILLARY TESTS:

Immunofluorescence
‘© IgM and C3 often positive in sclerotic areas or areas of
‘mesangial matrix increase
‘© Thought to be nonspecific entrapment
© IgMstaining without EM deposits does not appear to
have etiologic, prognostic, or diagnostic significance

Electron Microscopy

‘¢ Foot process effacement (FPE) typically not complete

‘© Secondary FSGS usually shows less FPE than idiopathic
Forms of FSGS

‘* InHIVAN, tubuloreticular inclusions can sometimes be
identified

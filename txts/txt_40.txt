history of years of anabolic
steroid use for bodybuilding

‘and mesangial expansion
i Right) In FSGS attributed
to anabolic steroid, there
were occasional vague
densities i; some having a
hyaline quality. IF did not
impart specificity to the
densities, suggesting that their
presence is secondary to
‘entrapment.

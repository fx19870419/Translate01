DIAGNOSTIC CHECKLIST

Pathologic Interpretation Pearls

* Podocyte hypertrophy (cytoplasmic basophilia) and tubular
reabsorption droplets are LM clues to diagnosis

‘* Multiple levels important to detect FSGS
© Note whether biopsy includes corticomedullary junction

© Acute tubular necrosis may be present and account for
acute renal failure

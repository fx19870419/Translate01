CLINICAL ISSUES

Epidemiology
«Incidence
(© ~ 10% of FSGS in adult renal biopsies in USA
= Rare in children < 10 years old except for genetic
forms
© Ethnicity
‘© Geographic/racial differences probably due to APOL 1 risk
alleles
— Black patients are disproportionately affected (20-50x
rate of nonblack patients)
— More common in FSGS series in Brazil (37%) than
Korea (1%) or india (2%)
Presentation
‘* Nephrotic syndrome or nephroticrange proteinuria, often
in absence of edema
‘© Hypoalbuminemia, hypercholesterolemia
«Renal dysfunction
‘© Elevated serum Cr at presentation; > than other types of
FSCS
Treatment
© Drugs
© Typically refractory to steroids
‘© Treatment of underlying condition, such as infection or
tumor, can lead to remission

Prognosis
‘* Poor prognosis oF idiopathic CGin all series
(© 47% progress to ESRD in 3 years
‘© 50% ESRD in 6 months
‘© More rapid progression than other types of FSGS
~ "Malignant” FSCS
«Improvement can occur in cases with recovery from or
removal of etiologic agent

MICROSCOPIC

Histologic Features
© Glomeruli
© Atleast 1 glomerulus with global or segmental
glomerular collapse and overlying epithelial hyperplasia
and hypertrophy, according to Columbia working
proposal
= Lowest possible threshold has led to marked increase
in diagnosis of CG
© Overlap with cellular variant of FSGS possible
© Visceral epithelial cells with hypertrophy and hyperplasia
= Urinary space may be filled with podocytes, forming
pseudocrescents
— Enlarged nuclet with open, vesicular chromatin and
Frequent nucleoli in acute phase
— Binucleate forms may be seen
— Mitotic Figures and apoptosis occasionally sampled in
pseudocrescents
Abundant and prominent protein reabsorption

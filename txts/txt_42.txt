~ Activates renal sympathetic nervous system by
intermittent hypoxia

~ Activates renin-angiotensin aldosterone system

~ Promotes hyperfiltration, glomerular hypertension,

sodium and water retention

Consequences of Glomerular Hyperfiltration
‘* Structural changes precede changes in Function
© Nephron hypertrophy or nephromegaly
= Glomerular and tubular hypertrophy
~ Progressive glomerular sclerosis, interstitial fibrosis,
and tubular atrophy
'* Physiologic
© Albuminuria (> 500 mg per day)
© Slowiy progressive proteinuria
© Proteinuria may eventually reach nephrotic range (> 3.5,
9/24 hours)
© Possible contributions of renal lipid accumulation unclear

‘CLINICAL ISSUES
Presentation

'* Middle-aged adults ~ 35-45 years most common

‘May also arise in children and older adults

‘ORG may be present without overt clinical disease
Slowly progressive proteinuria: Subnephroticin > 90%
Nephrotic range proteinuria in ~ 10%, but nephrotic
syndrome is rare (< 5%)

‘* Contribution of diabetic nephropathy to proteinuria in
metabolic syndrome

Treatment

'* Weight loss induces significant reduction of proteinuria
© Proteinuria reduction is directly proportional to weight
lost
‘© Reduction of proteinuria occurs within days on low
calorie diet
= May arise without change in GFR
'* Blockade of renin angiotensin system
© Angiotensin receptor blockers and angiotensin
converting enzyme inhibitors
— Reduction of glomerular hyperfiltration and
proteinuria
© Bariatricsurgery
© Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, gastric banding, and partial
gastrectomy
‘© Associated with weight loss, decreased GFR, and
‘eduction of proteinuria
Prognosis
‘Slowly progressive proteinuria often with hypertension and
T20M
© Slower progression compared with primary FSCS
‘# Renal survival 75% at 5 years and 50% at 10 years in ORG
BM associated with increased relative isk of ESRD
© Risk oF ESRD is directly proportional to BM in 1 large

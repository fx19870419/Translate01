TERMINOLOGY

« Idiopathic glomerular disease that causes nephrotic
syndrome with minimal or no light or immunofluorescent
‘microscopic abnormalities and diffuse podocyte foot
process effacement on electron microscopy

ETIOLOGY/PATHOGENESIS

© Usually idiopathic

«Involves loss of glomerular negative charge

© Circulating permeability Factor, likely autoimmune etiology

‘© Secondary Forms due to virus, drugs, lymphoma

CLINICAL ISSUES

'* Nephrotic syndrome

‘® Most common in young children, boys> girls

‘© 90-95% respond to corticosteroids

‘© Can present as acute renal insufficiency in adults

Normal Glomerulus

detected over podocytes Ha

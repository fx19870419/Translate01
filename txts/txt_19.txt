© Accumulation of hyaline at site of adhesion
© Segmental obsolescence of glomerular capillaries
‘© Zonal cortical distribution (worst at corticomedullary
junction)
© By definition, no glomerular collapse with podocyte
proliferation (feature of collapsing variant)
‘Tubules: Tubular resorption droplets and Focal atrophy,
associated with sclerotic glomeruli
Interstitium: Fibrosis, associated with atrophic nephrons
‘Vessels: No or variable intimal fibrosis and arteriolar
hyalinosis
Other Variants
© Tipvariant:
‘© Adhesion in tip region: Outer 25% of glomerulus next to
proximal tubule origin
= Affected segment may "hemniate" into tubular lumen
‘© Segmental lesions can contain endocapillary
hhypercellularity or sclerosis (often intracapillary Foam,
cells)
© May have adhesionsin other sites (except perihilar)
© Tiplesion can be seen in glomerular diseases other than
primary FSGS (e.g, thrombotic microangiopathy, GN)
© Cellular variant
© Expansile endocapillary hypercellularity occluding lumina
~ Intracapillary endothelial cells nd macrophage-type
Foam cells + neutrophils and lymphocytes
~ apoptosis with pyknotic or karyorrhectic debris,
~ fibrin within glomerular capillaries,
~ Noscar; possibly represents early stage
© Perihilar variant
© Sclerosis restricted to vascular pole in > 50% of glomeruli
© Rare in primary FSGS (< 10%), common in adaptive
(Secondary) FSGS
© Collapsing variant
© 21 glomerulus with segmental collapse and
bhypercellularity of visceral epithelium (podocytes)

ANCILLARY TESTS:

Immunohistochemistry

‘* Parietal epithelium on GBM expresses claudin-1 and pax-2
‘and may express CD44 (migration marker) and Ki-67(+)

Immunofluorescence

‘¢ Polyclonal igM and C3 in scarred segments

‘© Other stains most often negative or with minimal scattered
deposits (IgG, IgA, C1q, fibrin)

‘* Rarely delicate polyclonal IgG “dusting” over podocytes,
mostiy in tip variant

Electron Microscopy

‘+ Extensive podocyte FPE, typically > 50% oF capillary surface
area, assessed in nonsclerosed glomerulus

'* Normal GBM without rupture

‘* Noor minorimmune deposits

* Loss of podocytes with bridging of parietal epithelium to
GBMin areas of adhesion

* Cellular variant: Intracapillary foam cells and segmental
capillary occlusion
Collapsing variant: Subepithelial laminations of new GBM

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

FSGS Secondary to Adaptive Response

‘© Glomerular hypertrophy

‘ Perihilar distribution of adhesions and hyaline

«Less extensive FPE (by measure of Foot process width)

© Average foot process width > 1,500 um distinguishes

primary FSGS from secondary FSGS due to adaptive
response with ~ 100% sensitivity and ~ 70% specificity

Minimal Change Disease

‘© Cannot distinguish without presence of segmental
lomerulosclerosis

‘* Sampling issue without corticomedullary junction or smal
‘number of glomeruli

‘* May be expressions of same disease process

FSGS Due to Genetic Causes
'* Usually NOS variant; genetic testing required

FSGS Superimposed on Other Glomerular Diseases
‘* Segmental scars, collapse, and tip lesions may complicate
other glomerular diseases
© Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy needed
to detect underlying glomerular disease

DIAGNOSTIC CHECKLIST

Pathologic Interpretation Pearls
‘* Insetting of nephrotic syndrome and MCD, FSGS cannot
ruled out
© Presence of tubular atrophy even without glomerular
scaris suspicious
© Multiple levels may be necessary to demonstrate
segmental lesions
'* FSGS NOS is diagnosis of exclusion; other diseases can
result in segmental glomerular scars

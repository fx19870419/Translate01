Normal GBM Hypertrophied Podocytes
(Left) Jones methenamine cae

silver stain shows that the
GBMs have a normal thickness
lin MCD with no duplication
‘or glomerular hypercellularty
(Right) Glomerulus from a
atient with MCD appears
‘normal by light microscopy.
The only clue that there is
proteinuriais the presence of
‘hypertrophied podocytes i,
which have increased,
‘basophilic cytoplasm EB.

with MCD. Glomerul with an
immature appearance are

podocytes! This should not

essential to search for

i ‘evidence of FSGS in multiple

levels,as adhesions and

artifacts suchas this can

confound interpretation.

(Left) PAS(+) tubular

‘re found in any disease with

Oiled O stain ofa frozen

Uipid iin proximal tubules.
These accumulate in tubules in
all diseases with nephrotic.

the lipid was the only feature
‘noted originally in MCD it lead
to the term "ipoid nephrosis.”"

(© Higher risk of FSGS than general population

‘= Unilateral nephrectomy in adults no 1 risk for FSCS

'® Arteriosclerosis, with hypoperfusion of kidney & secondary
HIN

Pathologic Consequences
'* Glomerular hypertrophy
© 7 indiameter & number of mesangial cells
© Thickened GBM
© Relative deficiency of podocytes, which have limited
replicative ability
‘Segmental glomerular capilary scars and adhesions to
Bowman capsule
© Classically, adhesion & hyaline in perihlar region (perihitar
variant)
‘Murine Model
‘¢ Removal/infarction of upper & lower pole of kidney
Followed by contralateral nephrectomy (5/6 nephrectomy)
‘Results in HTN, glomeruiomegaly, & later, FSGS over 8-12
weeks with proteinuria & loss of renal Function
‘* Ameliorated by inhibitors of renin-angiotensin system
(angiotensin Il receptor inhibitors)

CLINICAL ISSUES
Epidemiology
* Incidence
© Apparent 1 incidence of ORG coincident with obesity
epidemic
Presentation
«Proteinuria is often > 3.5 g/d but usually without
hypoalbuminemia, hypercholesterolemia, & edema
© Specifically, ORG shows a greater 4 in incidence of
‘nephrotic syndrome than idiopathic FSGS,
«Renal dysfunction
‘© Most have T serum Cr& 4 glomerular filtration rate
(GFR) preceding development of nephrotic proteinuria
~ ORGis notable exception since it may have + GFR.
(Supemnormal, > 120 mL/min) 2°to hyperfiltration
Caused by 1 ratio of body mass to renal mass
© HTN
# ORG patients typically have BMI > 30
© BMI30.0-34.9, grade 1 obesity; BMI 35.0-39.9, grade 2
obesity; & BMI 2 40.0, grade 3 obesity (morbid obesity)
Treatment
© Drugs
© Steroids are not typically effective and may be
contraindicated
© Angiotensin Il receptor antagonists &/or ACE inhibitors
‘* Stop anabolic steroid, cocaine, or decongestant use
© Loweprotein diet
‘© Bariatricsurgery may normalize proteinuria in ORG.
Prognosis
‘© Adaptive FSGS more indolent than primary FSCS.
‘* Prognosis of perihilar variant of FSGS variable

Minimal Change Disease and C1q
Nephropathy

 

(Left) Glomerullin a 48-year-
‘old man with acute onset of
nephrotic syndrome and renal
failure (albumin 1 9/dl, 15/4
proteinuria, Cr 1.5 mg/dl)
show mild mesangial
hypercellularity. Dilated
tubules show flattened
epithelium IgA was
prominent by IF. (Right) IF in a
patient with an acute
‘nephrotic syndrome clinically
suspicious for MCD reveals
bright granular mesangial
staining for IgA BB. Glomeruli
‘showed similar staining for C3
and both light chains. There
was widespread foot process
effacement by EM.

(Left) ultrastructural study
reveals diffuse podocyte foot
process effacement, typical of
‘MCD BL Mesangial and
paramesangial electron-dense
deposits are present as well

53 part of lA nephropathy.
(Right) Biopsy from a 20-year.
ld man with sudden onset of
‘nephrotic syndrome with
anasarca and 10 9/4
proteinuria shows glomeruli
appearing normal. Ctq was 2+
in the mesangium associated
with electron-dense deposit.

(Left) Staining for C1q reveals
2+ granular mesangial
Staining MB. C1q was the
dominant immunoreactant in
‘his case; there was lesser
staining of glomeruli for lgG x
‘and y, and stains for lgA were
‘negative. The patient did not
‘have clinical or laboratory
‘evidence of SLE and otherwise

| had MCD. (Right) There are

scattered amorphous
mesangial electron-dense
deposits within the glomeruli
inthis patient with MCD and
C1q nephropathy =.

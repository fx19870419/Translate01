‘ Focal segmental glomerulosclerasis (FSCS)
Definitions

‘© Group of podocytopathies (oF varied etiology) sharing

Feature of FSGS, typically with moderate to heavy
proteinuria

CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS
Morphologic Classification
‘* Based on glomerular morphology, categories defined by
Columbia classification
© Collapsing variant
‘© Glomerular tip lesion
© Cellular variant
© Perihilar variant
FSGS not otherwise specified (NOS)
Etiologic Classification
‘® Based on identified causes of FSGS: Some correspondence
with morphologic variants
* ‘Idiopathic (orimary)
© Usval Form, either NOS or collapsing variant
© Circulating Factor iely responsible, identity elusive

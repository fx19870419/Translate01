CLINICAL ISSUES
Epidemiology

© Age
‘© Most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children
younger than 10 years (70-90% oF cases)
~ Median age of onset's 2.5 years; peak incidence at 2-3
years
‘© ~50% oF nephrotic syndrome in adolescents

‘© ~ 10-15% of nephrotic syndrome in adults, with late peak
incidence
~ 46% are 80-91 years
1 Sex
© Inchildren, MF =2:1
© Inadults, M
© Ethnicity
‘© More common in Caucasians and Asians than in African
‘Americans
Presentation
‘© Sudden (days) onset of nephrotic syndrome
 Nephrotic syndrome
© Proteinuria defined as > 3.5 g/d in adults and = 40 ma/m*
body surface area/hr in timed overnight collection in
children
~ Selective proteinuria (mainly albumin)
© Edema
© Hypoalbuminemia defined as serum albumin <2.5 g/dL
in children and < 3.5 g/dl in adults
(© Hypercholesterolemia
Liiduria
~ Lipid-aden enucleated tubular cells may be seen as.
“oval Fat bodies" in urinary sediment, with polarizable
lipid
~ Gave rise to term "tipoid nephrosis "original term for
McD
* Hematuria
‘© Microscopichematuria (10-30% of cases)
«Renal dysfunction
© Acute renal failure occurs in 25% of adults with MCD,
‘often with morphologic evidence of tubular injury
~ Associated with proteinuria > 10 9/4, serum albumin <
2 g/dl, hypertension, male sex, older age
~ Most recoverin 4-8 weeks
1 Elevated serum Cr often persists (mean 2.11 + 0.44)
© Serum Cr> 98th percentile in < 1/3 of children with MCD.
= Reduced glomerular hydraulic conductivity For small

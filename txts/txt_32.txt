Ectatic Tubules With PAS(+) Casts

= (Left) CG can be accompanied
FEE Bs by cubvioncersttiat dsecse,
s here shown at tow power.
3 BY Microostc dilation of

N Bes! proximal tubules filled with
PAS(+) protein is evident as
well as tabular atrophy and
interstitial inflammation.
(Right) Markedly dilated
tubules distended with PAS(s)
material are characteristic of
C6 ofall causes. Tubular
epithelia celsproferate os
wel as glomerular epithelial
cells

 
     
   

(Left) There is prominent
Interstitial inflammation
‘amidst these atrophic tubules,
many of which have
proteinaceous casts
(Right) Lymphoid interstitial
infiltrates are often prominent
jin CG and sometimes form
(ymphoepithelial structures
with tubules, as shown here.
The presence of
tubulointerstitial disease
indicates that CG is not
exclusively a “podocytopathy.”

(Left) The reactive tubular
cells in CG are shed in the
‘tubule, as shown here B. The
sloughed cells may also
‘include podocytes, which have
‘been detected in the urine.
(Right) This nephrectomy
specimen from a 7-year-old
‘boy with idiopathic CG was
done in preparation for renal
transplantation. Yellow areas
at the corticomedullary
junction Bare due to lipid in
tubules.

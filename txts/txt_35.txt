TERMINOLOGY
‘+ FSGS due to adaptive response to excess demand on
glomerular Function
ETIOLOGY/PATHOGENESIS.
«Adaptive structural-functional response
© Reduced nephron mass: Oligomeganephronia, reflux
nephropathy, renal agenesis/dysplasia, ablation, cortical
necrosis, advanced renal disease of any cause
© Normal nephron mass: Vascular disease, obesityrelated
lomerulopathy, atheroemboliasoocclusion, sickle cel
anemia, congenital heat disease, drugs (anabolic
steroids, calcineurin inhibitors)
* Podocytopenia due to maladaptive stress
CLINICAL ISSUES
*# Proteinuria & systemic HTN
Treatment
© Angiotensin il receptor antagonists &/or ACE inhibitors

atient with obesity and
‘metabolic syndrome shows
periilar segmental hyalinasis
‘and sclerosis and activated
parietal epithelial cells 22
Periilar glomerulosclerosisis
‘typical of adaptive FSGS but
‘ot specific.

 

(Left) Segmental C3
deposition occurs in areas of
glomerular scarring and
‘adhesion in FSGS due to any
cause, including, as illustrated
in this case, with adaptive
FSGS. gM shows a similar
‘pattern This is a common
pattern in other types of FSCS.
(Right) Adaptive FSCS most
‘often shows incomplete or
segmental foot process
effacement. This is best
‘assessed in a nonsclerotic
‘glomerulus. The GBM is
thickened, similar to that in
diabetes. (Courtesy H. Rennke,

© Low-protein diet, bariatric surgen
© Steroids not usually effective

MICROSCOPIC

© Glomerulomegaly

¢ Periilar glomerular adhesion & hyaline

© Compensatory tubular hypertrophy

© Often arteriolar hyalinosis, arteriosclerosis

¢ IF: Most notable for segmental gM & C3

‘¢ EM:Segmental podocyte foot process effacement

‘TOP DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSES

‘© Primary FSGS

‘* Underlying renal disease that caused nephron loss (e.g.
lomerulonephritis, Alport syndrome)

DIAGNOSTIC CHECKLIST

‘© Assess glomerular size in biopsies

‘* Rough guide: Normal glomeruli are < 50% of diameter of
40x Field of 440 ym.

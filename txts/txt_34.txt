(Left) CK8/18 shows
‘expression in visceral
epithelial cells Ein a patient
with CG. This cytokeratin is
normally expressed by parietal
epithelial cells c5}but not
podocytes. This likely
‘represents replacement of
podocytes by the parietal
epithelium. (Right) Ectopic

Podocytes do not normally
express CK19, although distal
tubules do:

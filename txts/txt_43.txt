Metabolic Syndr

  

MACROSCOPIC
Size
‘© Kidneys may be enlarged in massive obesity (BMI of > 40)

MICROSCOPIC
Histologic Features
© Glomeruli
© Glomerulomegaly with increased cross-sectional area
and volume of glomeruli
— Glomerular diameter averaged 226 um in 1 study
(controls 168 ym)
~ Rule of thumb: Diameter> 1/2 of 40x high-power field
most likely glomerulomegaly
= Thickened GMs
= Increased mesangial matrix + hypercellularity,
© Segmental glomerular sclerosis
= Tuft consolidation by matrix and hyaline with capilary
obliteration
~ Consolidated areas have foam cells in early stages
~ Characteristically located in the perihilar zone
20% pure perihilar and 80% perihilar and peripheral
int study
~ Extent of segmental sclerosis averages 6-12% of
glomeruli
1B ~40-50% in primary FSGS
© Global glomerular sclerosis with hyalinosis
‘© May be complicated by diabetic glomerulopathy
© Decreased glomerular density on low-power microscopy
~ Possibly atributable to
19 Tubular hypertrophy
12 Low initial nephron endowment:
© Tubules and interstitium
© Enlarged complex tubular profiles in hypertrophy
~ Larger diameter; may be nuclear crowding
© interstitial fibrosis, nonspecific mononuclear
inflammation, focal tubular atrophy
~ Maybe progressive
© Vessels
© Arteriosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis are common

ANCILLARY TESTS

Immunofluorescence

¢ IgM, C3, and C1q accumulate in hyalinized glomerular
segments,

+ Podocyte protein droplets contain IgG, IgA and albumin

‘¢ Noimmune complex deposits in the glomeruli

Electron Microscopy

Lipid droplets in mesangial cells and in podocytes

Thickened GBMs

Mesangial matrix expansion + hypercellularity

Partial or segmental foot process effacement

© 25-40% in ORG compared to > 75% in primary FSCS

‘© Segmental effacement even with nephrotic range
proteinuria

‘© Segmental detachment with basket-weave new
basement membrane

 

me/Obesity-Related Glomerular Disease

 
  

 

   
  

‘© Hyalinization typically intramembranous; no immune-type
electron-dense deposits

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Primary FSGS
‘* Proteinuria more severe and with sudden onset
© Glomeruli not enlarged
‘© Segmental sclerosis involves higher proportion of glo
‘© 40-50% in primary FSGS compared with 6-12% in ORG
associated FSGS
‘© Perihilar FSGS relatively uncommon at ~ 16% of adult
biopsies with primary FSGS
© Other variants collectively more frequent
© GBMs of normal thickness
‘© More extensive Foot process effacement in primary FSGS|
75%)
Diabetic Nephropathy
Early Features characterized by increased GFR and
‘microalbuminuria
¢ Persistent hyperalycemia and elevated hemoglobin A1C
© Glomeruli are enlarged with thickened basement
membranes in early disease
© Difficult or impossible to distinguish from ORG on
‘morphologic grounds
© Perihilar segmental sclerosis likely due to ORG
‘¢ Hyalinization of afferent and efferent arterioles

Other Secondary FSGS

* Arterionephrosclerosis: Vascular sclerosis, ischemic
glomerulopathy

'* Anabolic steroids: Clinical history

‘© Developmental disorders like hypoplasia and
oligomeganephronia
© Small kidneys with Fewer lobes; marked

glomerulomegaly

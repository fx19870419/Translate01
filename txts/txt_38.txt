Perihilar Adhesion and Scar in
Hypertensive Renal Disease

— =

    

(Left) One of the more
common causes of adaptive
FSGS is HTN, which causes
progressive loss of functional
nephrons and produces global
Bland segmental
‘glomerulasclerosis, as shown
here in a 63-year-old woman
with poorly controlled HTN for
30 years. (Right) Adoptive
W FSGS can arse from many
‘causes; inthis case, hilar
sclerosis and adhesions were
‘due to chronic renal disease
presumed to be hypertensive
‘nephropathy. Crwas 2.2, and

IgM Deposits Segmentally in FSGS

(Left) Late-stage bilateral
‘reflux nephropathy is one of
the classic causes of adaptive
FSGS. The remaining glomeruli
‘are hypertrophied IE the
spared tubules are also
ypertrophied = Perihilar
‘adhesions are present 31

jimmunofluorescence (If) in
patients with FSGS isto rule

disease. In FSCS ofall types,
‘segmental deposits of gM Hd
‘and C3 are in the segmental
lesions, sometimes with
‘segmental granular deposits
‘along the GBM.

Global Glomerulosclerosis

(Left) This glomerulus with
‘glomerular capillary loop
collapse has prominent
‘adhesions to the Bowman
capsule BB and no residual
‘open capillary lumina. This
Uikely represents alate stage
preceding global sclerosis.

process that leads to global
sclerosis. The lesion can be
confused witha fibrous
crescent.

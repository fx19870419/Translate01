Metabolic Syndrome/Obesity-Related Glomerular Disease

 

oder

TERMINOLOGY

* Obesity-related glomerulopathy (ORG) is glomerulomegaly
‘and secondary adaptive Focal FSGS arising in obese patients.
with body mass index of > 30 kg/m?

ETIOLOGY/PATHOGENESIS

* Increased body mass relative to kidney size

© Glomerular hypertension and hyperfiltration

'* Segmental sclerosis is predominantly in glomerular perihilar
zones

CLINICAL ISSUES

© Middle-aged adults ~ 35-45 years most commonly

‘* Slowly progressive proteinuria: Subnephrotic in > 90%

‘© Renal survival 75% at 5 years and 50% at 10 years in ORG

MICROSCOPIC

‘* Glomerulomegaly with increased cross-sectional area and
volume of glomeruli

‘¢ Segmental glomerular sclerosis,

Glomerulomegaly in Obesity-Related

Glomer
(Left) This glomerulus from a
26year-old woman with a
‘body mass index (BM) of 49.5,
‘is enlarged with mild
‘mesangial expansion but no
ypercellularty, a
characteristic feature of
obesity-related
_glomerulopathy (ORG). The
hilus EB)and ext pole Bare
‘present. (Right) This
‘glomerulus fills more than 1/2
of a 40x high-power field,
indicative of hypertrophy or
‘glomerulomegaly. The GEM is
‘generally thickened and there
‘is mld mesangial expansion.
Capilaries are open, and
cellularity is normal.

(Left) This glomerulus from a
33-year-old obese man with 2
{9 proteinuria has segmental
‘sclerosis(2Badjacent to the
hhilus or vascular pole. There
‘appears to be mild mesangial
hypercellularity BB, although
‘his could be the effects of a
‘near transhilar section. (Right)
This glomerulus from a 60-
‘year-old man with a BMI of
35.4 and proteinuria is
‘enlarged and has hyalinization
‘on each side ofthe hilus 3.
The upper hyalinized segment
‘has broad adhesion to
‘Bowman capsule. Macula
densa and juxtaglomerular
‘apparatus are also shown,

‘* Enlarged complex tubular profiles in hypertrophy
